    <p class="light">Hello! My name is Gurpreet Kaur and I am 19 years old
        and I am a junior majoring in Information Technology with a focus in mobile/web development. \
        I plan to work as a developer in the future. So I want to be familar with all topics related to developing a website, hosting a website, and 
        coding in general. IT 4213 - Mobile Web Development is my second web development course so I am excited to learn all 
        the new topics. I also plan on doing an internship so I think this course's coursework will help me prepare for the interview.<br><br>
	Three Fun Facts About Me:<br>
	&emsp;1. I play tennis for fun.<br>
	&emsp;2. I love binge watching TV shows.<br>
	&emsp;3. I would watch sitcoms everyday if I had the time. <br><br>

Currently I am enrolled in the following class: IT 4123 - Mobile Web Development which is taught by Dr. Jack Zheng.
This course is meant to introduce us to many concepts, practices and technologies. This course goes into more depth
 about web sites, applications, mobile devices, etc. If you'd like to know more about this course, go to the following link <a href="http://it4213.azurewebsites.net/">here</a>.<br><br>

      <p class="light"><br>Lab 2 Answers: <br>1) The mobile device I have is the Apple iPhone 12 Pro. It has a A14 Bionic chip which is a next-generation Neural Engine. Also, it
         has a 6.1 inch screen size and super Retina XDR display. It has a resolution of 1170 x 2532 pixels. The viewport resolution is 390 x 844 pixels.
         The browser on my iPhone is Safari and its version is 14.0.
        <br>
        <br> 2) a) In general a viewport is the part of a webpage that the user can see. On mobile devices, there are two types of viewports, one
         is the layout viewport. The layout viewport is how the website is rendering the website.
         The other is the visual viewport which is whats actually being shown on the screen and is the pixels the device's screen in rendering. 
         So, the visual viewport is whats visible on-screen meanwhile the kayout viewport covers the elements on a page. For example, if the 
         user was to zoom into the screen, the visual viewport shrinks but the layout viewport stays the same.
         <br><br>
        b)<a /href="http://it4213.azurewebsites.net/demo/" > On this IT 4213 demo site</a>, the text appears so small on a mobile device
         because it does not have the mega tag. Infact, Apple had introduced the "viewport meta tag" so web developers can control the viewport's size and scale. 
         If the mobile site has something like the following then the page and text will appear like normal: <br> meta name = "viewport" content = "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"
