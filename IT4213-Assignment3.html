      Lab 5 - Task 4: Summarize your experience using CSS grid method for responsive layout design, comparing to floats and flexbox.
      <br>
      I had a good experience using the CSS grid method since it is very useful when implementing a responsive layout across different screen sizes. 
      It made the process of implementing the page in different rows and columns extremely easy and straightforward and did not require writing a lot of code.
      The CSS grid property can be used to align boxes or divs across rows and columns, but CSS flexbox property only works on either rows or columns but not both. 
      So, to create the same design with flexbox would be more difficult and would require a lengthy code. 
      The CSS float property lets developers incorporate table-like columns without the use of tables. Floats are hard to work with 
      since we must clear float for each element for elements appearing before or after. If this is not done correctly, then structure of element breaks.
      So, with floats, the alignment results are not as great, and neither is the process easy. 
      Overall, using the CSS grid property is best to making a responsive page.
