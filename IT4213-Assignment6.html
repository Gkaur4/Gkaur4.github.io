  <p class="light">Lab 11 Task: We are going to use the following 
  test methods to test some websites and observe the site display.
    <br><br>1) Using browser developer/simulation tools <br>
      <ul>
        <li><a /href= "https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/">

  <ul>
    <li>Summary: overall test result and conclusion.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>The test results indicated that the web page is mobile friendly with 
              slight differences. The site used graceful degradation since the 
              website was built for desktop first and then media queries were used 
              for mobile deviced. Overall, the website has several uses of good 
              techniques and some that can be modified.
          </li>

  <ul>
    <li>Testing method and environment (hardware/software).</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Testing Method: Google Chrome Developer Tools to emulate mobile 
        viewports. And, iphone 12 pro.</li>
          <li>Environment: <br>(Windows 10 Home: Version 2004 19041.928) <br>
          (Google Chrome: Version 90.0.4430.93 (Official Build) (64-bit))</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Basic mobile web approach: none, adaptive, responsive, hybrid, 
    media query strategy (mobile first, break points, etc.), etc.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>This site appears to be adaptive and responsive as it uses  
          Graceful Degradation media queries.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Analyze and critique its mobile design on the following 
    elements. Identify responsive patterns implemented (if any). 
    For each part, present screenshots to support your statements or analysis.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Page Layout - The page is in a block display.</li>
          <li>Navigation (menu) - The navigation menu contains 
          block display and the elements are located on the left while in 
          full size resolutions meanwhile in small resolutions, the navigation 
          menu is up top with a toggle.</li>
          <li>Data/information presentation (list, grid, table, if any) - 
          The site mainly displays a block display when its first opened up 
          and displays a table display at smaller resolutions.</li>
          <li>Form input elements (if any) - This site has two form inputs 
          which has a text input (the KSU search bar) and a submit input 
          (Search)</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Any other notable design and usability issues, and potential solutions.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>There is not any other issues which look too noticable as the site works great 
          on my iphone 12 pro and my laptop.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
      <li>Attach the testing reports generated from the two automated testing 
      tools. Read the reports and compare them to your own findings. 
      Identify and report anything you find notable or inconsistent 
      with your own evaluation.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The first report from "Mobile-friendly test" indicated that the website 
            is mobile friendly. The second report from "mobiReady" indicated that the 
            website has the following issues: No Etag header found, JavaScript placement, 
            Gzip Encoding, frames, CSS measurements, and caching control.</li>
      </ul>

 <ul>
     <li>Summary: overall test result and conclusion.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The test results mention that this website is not 
           this web mobile friendly as there is no use of fluid layout patterns and 
           the device-width is not set in the viewport meta. The text is 
           also indicated to be too small to read and the clickable elements are 
           too close to eachother.</li>

     responsive, hybrid, media query strategy (mobile first, 
     break points, etc.), etc.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>This website does not consist of any basic mobile web 
          approach and no resizing feature has been applied.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
     <li>Analyze and critique its mobile design on the following elements. 
     Identify responsive patterns implemented (if any). For each part,
     present screenshots to support your statements or analysis.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Page Layout - This web page has no sort of responsive 
          pattern and does not utilize the viewport meta for the mobile 
          layout.</li>
          <li>Navigation (menu) - The navigation menu is a list on top 
          and is floated it to the left within a block display.</li>
          <li>Data/information presentation (list, grid, table, if any) - 
          The data/information presentation does not contain any fluid patterns for mobile devices. The 
          main content is contained in a block display with
           no responsive patterns.</li>
          <li>Form input elements (if any) - The form elements are displayed as a block and 
          contain no responsive design pattern.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
     <li>Any other notable design and usability issues, and potential solutions.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>This web page has no responsive pattern so a potential 
          solution would be to implement graceful degradation design to make
          all elements responsive for all screen resoultions. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>  
  
  <ul>
     <li>Attach the testing reports generated from the two automated 
     testing tools. Read the reports and compare them to your own findings. 
     Identify and report anything you find notable or inconsistent with your own evaluation.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Both reports indicate that the website is not mobile friendly.
          Some main fails were that Etag header was not found. All page assets 
          should include its proper Etag headers in order to have client-side 
          caching and to speed page loads. SOme other findings were regarding 
          JavaScript placement, stylesheet placement, Gzip Encoding, Frames, and CSS.

  <ul>
     <li>Summary: overall test result and conclusion.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The testing results are accurate to what I thought. 
          Just by opening up this website we can see how perfectly 
          formatted this website is and it is responsive along with
          many other features. The testing I performed indicated that the website 
          is mobile friendly. When the resolution is changed the patterns 
          are slightly different to display 
          everything all together and everything is being resized.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

          viewports. And, iphone 12 pro.</li>
          <li>Environment: <br>(Windows 10 Home: Version 2004 19041.928) <br>
          (Google Chrome: Version 90.0.4430.93 (Official Build) (64-bit))</li>
      </ul>

  </ul>

  <ul>
     <li>Basic mobile web approach: none, adaptive, responsive, hybrid, 
     media query strategy (mobile first, break points, etc.), etc.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>This website uses the meta tag on all web pages in order 
          to make it responsive for all resolutions.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
     <li>Analyze and critique its mobile design on the following elements. I
     dentify responsive patterns implemented (if any). For each part, 
     present screenshots to support your statements or analysis.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Page Layout - This web page shrinks when 
          the page resolution is decreased.</li>
          <li>Navigation (menu) - The navigation menu is on the left 
          at all times and you press the toggle to see options of 
          other web pages. </li>
          <li>Data/information presentation - The main content is represented 
          by images on the main page. </li>
          <li>Form input elements (if any) - In the footer of the 
          webpage, there is the connect with us column in which there is a text 
          input and submit input, </li>
          <img src="Input Element SS.PNG" alt="ccse input" width="350" height="200">

      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
     <li>Any other notable design and usability issues, and 
     potential solutions.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>While using the website, everything works fine but I 
          noticed that the navigation menu on left has a bug. As in when it is clicked on 
          and opened the media option is there while the other options such as: story, store 
          locator, FAQs, privacy policy float in. The solution would be to 
          implement the same design on the media option as the other options. <br>
          I have attached a video below.</li>

    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
     <li>Attach the testing reports generated from the two 
     automated testing tools. Read the reports and compare 
     them to your own findings. Identify and report anything 
     you find notable or inconsistent with your own evaluation.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Both automated testing tools indicated that the 
          website is mobile friendly but there were several 
          failures found in the JavaScript placement and basically 
          the whole code. And there are fails regarding the Stylesheet placement,
          CSS measurements, and caching control.</li>
